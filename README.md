* Project details are in the following content.
### Task Description:
This project is a demonstration of using TensorFlow for text classification in non-English/local languages. Here we choose Bengali as the local language to solve a multi- class classification task where we classify Bengali news articles in 5 categories. The word embedding method - FastText is applied to extract meaningful features. TensorFlow’s pretrained embedding exporter can convert the word embedding to a text embedding module first and then use the module to train a classifier to build a small sequential model which is a linear stack of layers. As we can see in the classification report, finally we gain a 0.96 precision and accuracy after training data set only 5 epochs.
